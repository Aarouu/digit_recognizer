# Handwritten Digit Recognition with ANN & CNN

This project allows you to **draw handwritten digits using a Pygame canvas** and predicts them using either an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** or a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the MNIST dataset.

The CNN version is more accurate and robust to small variations in handwriting, while the ANN is simpler and easier to understand.

- Draw digits with mouse in a Pygame window
- Clear canvas with `C` key
- Live predictions displayed in the window
- Optional data augmentation for CNN
